            The workforce is integral to the global and local economies but
            stays largely at the bottom of the pyramid, with skewed
            participation of women and trans people facing issues related to
            inequity, bias, discrimination, harassment, and violence.

            Systems generally tend to transact rather than engage with the
            workforce. Their wellbeing is mostly considered a ‘cost’ not an

            A large number of the workforce are migrants, experiencing exclusion
            and poverty as a result of inadequate resources, and support, and a

            and systems.

          With rising climate, health, and occupational risks threatening
          millions of lives and livelihoods, the world is transitioning from
          being Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA) to being
          Brittle, Anxious, Non-Linear, and Incomprehensible (BANI), where the
          workforce tend to get caught in a vicious loop of poverty,
          unemployment, precarious work, and living conditions. In both
          VUCA/BANI-led labour markets, employers and industries too are caught
          up between businesses, growth, and production at one end and
          attrition, absenteeism, and productivity at the other end.

            workforce?

            Research substantiates that an empowered workforce fosters economic
            growth, which can be backed by comprehensive efforts and good
            practices. With an investment of $10 trillion projected by 2035, the
            benefits can only be realised if we invest in our workforce (Centre
            for Economics and Business Research (CEBR)).
